Lifetimes, turning into fractures of moments as I blink my eyes open. Memory represents space in this world, and the processor is time. A simple organizing principle. I walk through this world, uncovering layers of information in bits. My memory builds places on top of coordinates, stacking information and emotion onto the spatial grid.

And as soon as I wake up, it all feels insignificant. Memory represents space in this world, and the processor is time. A simple organizing principle. I walk through this world, uncovering layers of information in bits. My memory builds places on top of coordinates, stacking information and emotion onto the spatial grid.

Then one time you came down to sit with me. We talked for centuries, right here, me becoming you and you becoming me. And then, all of the sudden, my heartbeat synced with the static on your hands. We synced. In dreams, things can be distorted, strange. Walls can move and creatures change shape. But I knew exactly where I was, every time. And I knew instinctively where to find you.
